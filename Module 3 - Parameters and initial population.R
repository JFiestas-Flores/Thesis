#The reason to bring more water is to prepare for future treatment and keep the recycling ratio
# G1: This is because the cost of bringing the fresh water to production is lower than to bring it into the pond
# G2: Has similar cost for fresh water to production and to the pond
# G3: Is with a contraint (bringing the extra water is a cost)

#the longer the wait, the more concentration builds up (higher treatment cost)
#early treatment will have an impact on operation costs

# EXPLAIN THE TRADE OFF on when to start, regulation and treament
# 1.1 Incentive to delay de treatment ... Timing is important due the trade off
# 1.2 Different unit costs from technologies... will depend on the starndard (can't just be said which is most cost effective)
# 1.3 The regulator and public might be thinking about the risk of toxicity 
# 1.3 Different demands from different stakeholder (in a diplomatic way)
# 1.4 Anything in the system to treat thing sooner: The standard, means more cost to the company
# 1.4 Another variable is risk to the public
# 1.5 This a more complex life cycle analysis without holding many things constants

#More fresh water = less recycling = increase dilution
# The water used in production is the sum of recycling and fresh
# Building it up by increasing fresh water and recycling less
# A constraint would limite the treatment for a year, so that means early treatment

# The change in concentration when diluted is going down
# cbind(WCR$MineResults$PondWater,WCR$Pollution$concPollutants[,3],WCR$Effluent$Summer_PostTreatConc[,3])
# PostreatConc when no treatment = ?

#Set very weak standards (G_a G_c)
#TDS up to 3000 and start before it accumulates
#Or increase the target for NAs
# Revise OZ treatment target's effect

# About the cones
# - all of the costs are in the cost functions
# - We decide how much is treated (GA) and that is forced back into mosek
# - We are getting a set of flows of water (we are forcing bitumen, amount of water, flexibility comes from fresh and recycled water)
# - Replace it for a set of equations

##### End first call to Water Cost Model  #############################################

## Set parameters here and functions costs in script 2

## Subtract decimal dust from the bit cost
## Big penalty from pitlake at the end, but wetland is not being built


## Four graphs 
# - No treatment 50 (Decision variable 7 = 0) (NT PosPeriod = 10) (Done)NT_Post10_NOwet
# - Release wetland 50 (NT PosPeriod = 10) (Done) NT_Post10
# - Release wetland 50 (NT PosPeriod = 10) (Done) Higher Wetland efficiency NT_Post10Medwet
# - Release wetland 60 (NT PosPitlake = 10) (Done)

## New graphs
# - Lower target with higher targets for 0.043

# Add assumptions

## Are assumptions correct?
## Is dilution ok?
## Increase wetland effectivmness #change

## Is going down because of dilussion (we are not adding anything new)
# - Add a slide: Assumptions needed
# - Is for economist (very small niche)
# Encourage them to think this is a thought experiment
# Why don't you track these things?
# Run off water is diluting the water with same tds concentration
# This is a thought experiment

# All first 4 are done

## AFTER COSIA Meeting
# Set a decision variable for the pitlake target (To increase the role of dilution)
## 1: Set it as the target for the pitlake, bounded (to respond to the concentration problem)
## 2: Timing and flow rate as a decision variable
